# TestingGemini

## Project Introduction

### Overview
This is a personal, simple learning and testing project, aimed at exploring and testing the functionalities of two models: GPT-4 and Gemini. The project serves as a modest share of my experiences in this area.

### Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:
- **To learn and test the models**: Gain hands-on experience with GPT-4 and Gemini by calling their APIs and testing their capabilities.
- **To share experiences**: Document and share insights and findings from experimenting with these models.

- Gemini: [Google AI Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart)

## 3. Environment Setup and Execution
The necessary steps for environment setup and execution are as follows:
- For running GPT-4 image description:
   1. Install Python.
   2. Install dependency packages.
   3. Input your image in the path.
   4. Add your API key.

- For testing Gemini:
   1. Run it directly through Colab: [Colab Notebook for Gemini](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/site/en/tutorials/python_quickstart.ipynb).
   2. Alternatively, set up the necessary libraries and dependencies locally (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
   3. Modify your API key and the image you want to load for description.

*Note: If you have any questions about the above instructions, please leave a message in the issues section.*

## 5. Results Comparison
At present, Gemini seems to yield results similar to those of GPT-4, although this project has not conducted extensive and rigorous testing.

## 7. Conclusion
   1. Both Gemini and GPT-4 are outstanding language models for AI applications, particularly in image recognition.
   2. As of now, both APIs are functioning well. However, Gemini seems a bit slower in producing results compared to GPT-4.
   3. GPT-4 generally provides more stable outputs. In limited testing, Gemini sometimes exhibited hallucinations.
